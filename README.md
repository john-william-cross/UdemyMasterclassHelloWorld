# UdemyMasterclassHelloWorld

After finishing DMACC's CodeDSM java course, I am taking this Udemy course to review what was taught and to continue
upon what I've learned so far. I will go through the entire course and refrain from skipping over lessons even when
they cover things I already know- hence the creation of this repository even though my current skills go quite beyond
"HelloWorld".
